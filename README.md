# App_Store_Analysis
Short analysis of mobile application data

This short analysis uses data from the Google Play store (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps) and the App Store (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps) to practice cleaning and organizing data and make recommendations regarding which genre of app might be best for development to appeal to both Android and Apple users.
